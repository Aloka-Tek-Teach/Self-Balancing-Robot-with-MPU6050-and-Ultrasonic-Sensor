It seems you're asking for a connection diagram (or circuit diagram) for your balancing robot code using an MPU6050 sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and motors. Here’s how the components can be connected to an Arduino (assuming you're using an Arduino Uno):

### Circuit Connections:

#### 1. **MPU6050 (Gyroscope/Accelerometer) Sensor**
- **VCC** → **5V** on Arduino
- **GND** → **GND** on Arduino
- **SCL** → **A5** on Arduino (for I2C communication)
- **SDA** → **A4** on Arduino (for I2C communication)

#### 2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
- **VCC** → **5V** on Arduino
- **GND** → **GND** on Arduino
- **Trig** → **Pin 8** on Arduino
- **Echo** → **Pin 9** on Arduino

#### 3. **Motors (using motor driver)**
- **Motor Driver Inputs** (assuming L298N motor driver)
  - **IN1** → **Pin 3** on Arduino (for left motor)
  - **IN2** → **Pin 4** on Arduino (for left motor)
  - **IN3** → **Pin 5** on Arduino (for right motor)
  - **IN4** → **Pin 6** on Arduino (for right motor)
- **Motor Power (VCC)** → **External Power Supply** (depending on motor voltage)
- **Motor Ground (GND)** → **GND** on Arduino
- **Motor Out (OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4)** → Connect to the motors as per the motor driver instructions

### Example Table of Connections:

| Component          | Pin on Arduino  | Pin on Component   | Notes                    |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| MPU6050 VCC        | 5V              | VCC                | Power supply to sensor   |
| MPU6050 GND        | GND             | GND                | Ground                   |
| MPU6050 SDA        | A4              | SDA                | I2C data line            |
| MPU6050 SCL        | A5              | SCL                | I2C clock line           |
| HC-SR04 Trig       | Pin 8           | Trig               | Trigger pin for ultrasonic|
| HC-SR04 Echo       | Pin 9           | Echo               | Echo pin for ultrasonic  |
| Motor Left IN1     | Pin 3           | IN1                | Left motor control       |
| Motor Left IN2     | Pin 4           | IN2                | Left motor control       |
| Motor Right IN3    | Pin 5           | IN3                | Right motor control      |
| Motor Right IN4    | Pin 6           | IN4                | Right motor control      |
| Motor Driver GND   | GND             | GND                | Ground                   |
| Motor Driver VCC   | External Power  | VCC                | Motor power source       |

### Tips:
- Use a motor driver (like L298N or L293D) to control the motors. These drivers allow you to control the direction and speed of the motors using digital pins.
- Make sure to connect the motor power supply to the motor driver, not directly to the Arduino.
- For balancing robots, the MPU6050 will provide the angle information, and the ultrasonic sensor will measure the distance from obstacles (though it’s not currently used for control in your code).
